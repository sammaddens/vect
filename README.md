# Vect

The `vect` package provides an improved vector notation by involving *TikZ*.

## Introduction

The `vec` command gives a vector with the arrow notation, but it isn’t designed for multiple characters. This package provides an improved vector notation by involving *TikZ*. Additional, the kind of notation (arrow or bold) can easily be changed.

More detailed information is available in the package documentation.

## Installation

You can install the package in **MiKTeX** as follows.

1. Open the main root directory (where all distributed packages are installed). You find this directory also in the MiKTeX Console: Settings → Directories.

2. **Optional** When you prefer to store new undistributed packages in another folder (e.g. `MyLibrary`), you need to add it as a new root directory in the MiKTeX Console: Settings → Add (+). Create two directories in that folder: `tex/latex` and `doc/latex`. Finally, open that root directory instead of the main root.

3. Create a folder `vect` in `tex/latex` of a root directory. If you want to store the documentation, you also need to create a `vect` folder in `doc/latex`.

4. Place the file `vect.sty` in `tex/latex/vect`.

5. **Optional** Place the files of the documentation in `doc/latex/vect`.

6. Refresh the MiKTeX Console: Tasks → Refresh file name database.

7. The package is installed.
